* A Brief History of Joe Biden and School Busing
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/joe-biden-busing-timeline.html
* Joe Biden likes to portray himself as a civil rights champion. But in the 1970s, he was a prominent opponent of one of the era’s key desegregation measures: school busing. His extensive history of strategic race-baiting to win over conservative voters does not bode well for his 2020 hopes.	https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-president-busing-racism

* 16 Conservative takeover of Supreme Court

* Joe Biden played a more consequential role in the history of the Supreme Court than almost any senator in American history. As the longtime chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he presided over the confirmation hearings of five Justices, and, over his long career, he voted on the nominations of more than a dozen Justices.
https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/biden-and-the-supreme-court
As chairman, Biden closed the hearings before airing a full investigation of Hill’s claims. He refused to allow public testimony from several witnesses who corroborated Hill’s description of Thomas’s behavior. This fecklessness is a source of lingering anger at Biden for many liberals, especially since history appears to have vindicated Hill’s version of events and Thomas has become the Court’s most extreme conservative.
* In 1991, Joe Biden Was Skeptical Clarence Thomas Would Be Extreme On Abortion
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-clarence-thomas-abortion_n_5cfe9742e4b02ee3477b0c50
Abortion rights advocates warned senators that putting Thomas on the Supreme Court would be a disaster for women’s rights. Biden was less convinced.

* Anthony Kennedy - When the Senate voted on Kennedy's nomination, he received bipartisan support. Maureen Hoch of PBS wrote that he "virtually sailed through the confirmation process and was widely viewed by conservatives and liberals alike as balanced and fair".[22] The U.S. Senate confirmed him on February 3, 1988, by a vote of 97 to 0.[18]

* Clarence Thomas Supreme Court Nomination - On July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court of the United States to replace Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement.[1] The nomination proceedings were contentious from the start, especially over the issue of abortion, and many women's groups and civil rights groups opposed Thomas on the basis of his conservative political views, as they had also opposed Bush's Supreme Court nominee from the previous year, David Souter.[2]

* Anita Hill - Anita Faye Hill is an American lawyer and academic. She is a university professor of social policy, law, and women's studies at Brandeis University and a faculty member of the university's Heller School for Social Policy and Management.

* David Brock wrote an article titled "The Real Anita Hill" for the 1992 The American Spectator magazine, which argued against her veracity. He also wrote a 1993 book of the same name. However, he would later denounce these works in a 2003 book titled Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative.[64]

* The Woman Not Called During the Clarence Thomas Hearings
https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/woman-not-called-clarence-thomas-hearings 
* Angela Wright is a freelance journalist living in Charlotte, NC, and a senior facilitator with The OpEd Project. She is the “uncalled witness” from the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas Confirmation Hearing.
* She heard characters repeat the words of a column she wrote, not for publication but for a writing sample, which was leaked to the office of Senate Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Joseph Biden  and led to a subpoena.  
* Biden in "Confirmation": “A lot of the criticism for the movie is that it made Chairman Biden appear weak and ineffective — and he was. The Republicans metaphorically stoned Anita Hill, while the Democrats, Biden being the gatekeeper, let it happen ... To me, having worked on both sides of the aisle — Republican and Democratic — what I know for sure, Republicans are like bare-fisted street brawlers, Democrats do pillow fights.”
